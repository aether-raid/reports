# A Primer on Brain Foundation Models

<!-- 
Research in computational neuroscience and cognitive science has taken a new turn with the introduction of **brain foundation models**.

The promise of brain foundation models, or BFMs, is simple: generically modelling the relationship between various input channels via a *large* amount of data. Be it a general game of Atari, or a driving simulator, or just activities of daily living, we collect data from all across this domain, put it together and feed it all *raw* to a model, so it can learn and find relations normal models cannot.
